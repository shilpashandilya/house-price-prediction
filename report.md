# **House Price Prediction - Report & Documentation**

## **1. Introduction**
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The model is deployed as a REST API using Flask and can be accessed via JSON requests. The system allows users to input property details and receive a price prediction in INR.

---

## **2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
### **Dataset**
The dataset used for training was sourced from **Kaggle's House Price Dataset**. It contains attributes such as location, size, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and air conditioning.

### **Steps Taken:**
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Imputed missing numerical values with the median.
   - Filled missing categorical values with the mode.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features like `price_per_sqft`.
   - Converted categorical features (e.g., `furnishing_status`, `air_conditioning`) into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

3. **Scaling & Encoding**
   - Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.
   - Used **Label Encoding** for categorical variables.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Removed low-variance features.
   - Used **correlation analysis** to select relevant attributes.

## **3. Model Selection & Optimization**
### **Model Chosen:**
- **Random Forest Regressor** was selected for its ability to handle non-linearity and complex interactions between features.

### **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
- Tuned the model using **GridSearchCV** to optimize parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.

### **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | **29,000 INR** |
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | **21,500 INR** |
| RÂ² Score | **0.91** |

The model provides **91% accuracy**, making it a reliable predictor of house prices.

## **4. Deployment Strategy**
The trained model was saved using **Pickle** and deployed as a **Flask API**.

### **Deployment Steps:**
1. **Developed a Flask API** with the `/predict` endpoint to receive JSON inputs and return price predictions.
2. **Containerized** the application using **Docker** for seamless deployment.
3. **Hosted the API on Render**, ensuring it is publicly accessible.
4. **Frontend UI** created using **HTML, CSS** to allow users to enter property details and get predictions.
